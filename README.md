Crash Landing

## Crash Landing!

Traveling an alien, Soovin finds out there is a beautiful planet 
where she can dream "happily ever after."
Then, BOOM!
Soovin crash-landed on the planet.
 
 
As an international student, I live as an alien in the United States. I often feel I do not belong to this place since I am an alien, and I bring that feeling to a website portraying my identity as a crash landing on the wrong planet. I created this crash-landed UFO as my avatar in cyberspace based on my personal experience in the States for the past five years. 


The last project using the Three.js opportunity opened my eyes to the website's world-building technique. Therefore, I challenged myself to use Three.js and Blender to create Crash Landing. I used Three.js to make the “warp” page, making the audience feel fall. Also, I used OrbitControls.js to control the scene for focusing on the UFO in the center and GLTFLoader for loading twenty .glb files into the scene. Using Trnio, I could scan my torso and ride the UFO in this world.
The lonely, empty but filled with cultural confusion and super-Korean features of myself are depicted as traditional Korean shoes, Korean traditional accessories, airplane, and lotus.
